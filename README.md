# Motocross RPG: The Road to Legend

A single-player, offline motocross career RPG. Start as an unknown rider with a broken 50cc and work your way up to legend.

This is **test build 0.1**: the first playable prototype. You can walk around Home Town and the Industrial Zone, go in and out of every Area 1 building, talk to nine NPCs, and save and continue. All art is placeholder art in the agreed style, imported from the project's art threads.

## Play it

- **In a browser:** once GitHub Pages is switched on (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions), every push to `main` publishes the game to this repo's Pages site.
- **On your own computer:** install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS), then:

  ```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  and open the address it prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

### Controls

| Action | Keyboard and mouse | Touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Walk | WASD or arrow keys, or click where you want to go | Tap where you want to go |
| Talk to an NPC or use an object | Click it, or face it and press E or Space | Tap it |
| Next line of dialogue | Click, E, Space or Enter | Tap the box |
| Zoom (50% to 200%) | Mouse wheel, or + and - | + and - buttons |
| Pause menu (save, settings) | Esc | ☰ button |

## What's in this build

Checked against the first-build checklist in the Systems Specification, section 22:

- Main menu that opens straight away: New career, Continue, Load, Settings, Archive, Info, Exit.
- Settings that apply at once, save automatically and have Restore Defaults.
- Home Town, the Industrial Zone and all 12 interiors, built from the art threads' Tiled maps with the finished buildings.
- WASD and click-to-move. Clicking a blocked tile walks to the nearest reachable tile; clicking an NPC walks to a free tile beside them and opens dialogue.
- Doors load the interior, and leaving returns you to the tile outside that building.
- Map caching: a map's images and ground are kept after the first visit, so going back is near-instant.
- Content checks: every data file is checked when the game starts, and a broken file stops the game with the file and field named.
- Versioned saves with 5 rotating backups. A damaged save is kept and the newest good backup is offered.
- Autosave every 5 minutes, plus Save now in the pause menu.

## How the project is laid out

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core/` | Game rules with no graphics: pathfinding, saves, settings, content checks, doors and exits. Covered by tests. |
| `src/scenes/` | Phaser screens: boot, menus, settings, the world and the on-screen HUD. |
| `src/world/` | Drawing maps and characters. |
| `public/data/` | Game content as JSON: NPCs and dialogue. More content files join these as systems arrive. |
| `public/assets/` | Art and baked maps, written by the import tool. Don't edit by hand. |
| `tools/import-art.mjs` | Copies the art from the shared art folder and bakes each Tiled map into one game-ready file. |
| `tests/` | Unit tests, plus checks that every door, exit and NPC on the real maps works. |

### Technology

TypeScript, [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for tests. Saves are JSON in the browser's storage; a desktop app wrapper (Tauri) with saves as files comes in a later build. None of the Adventure Land code is used.

### Updating the art

When the art threads change a map or sprite, run the import tool against the shared art folder and commit the result:

```
npm run import-art -- /path/to/art
npm test
```

### Checks

```
npm test          # unit tests and map checks
npm run build     # type check and production build into dist/
```
